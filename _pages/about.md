<!-- Intro -->
Born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal but with strong northern roots in *Trás-os~Montes*. Annoying 
    anyone and everyone with questions since 1999, Diogo always had a very inquisitive nature on 
    how things work. Growing up with Legos and a strong interest in physics, Diogo pursued sciences 
    in highschool but made a 90° turn into programming after learning how to make games for his 
    Texas Instruments TI-84 graphic calculator.

<!-- Education - BSc -->
Diogo enrolled in a BSc in *Informatics Engineering* at *Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de 
    Lisboa* (FCUL) where he acquired core programming knowledge mainly focused on Java but also dabbling 
    in the '*Web trifecta*' (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), SQL, Haskell, C and Python. He concluded
    in 2020 with a final grade of 16.

<!-- Begun in LASIGE as Undergraduate Student -->
On December 2019, while on his BSc, he began as an undergraduate student at 
    [LASIGE][lasige]{: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a research unit at FCUL, 
    under the coordination of professors Vasco Vasconcelos and Andreia Mordido in a new programming 
    language, *FreeST*. *FreeST* focuses on safe channel communication, or in other words, 
    guaranteeing communication follows a pre-defined protocol.

<!-- Experience - Bee2Waste -->
In the summer of 2020, between finishing his BSc and starting his MsC, Diogo participated as a 
    fellow at the CryptoSummer summer school at NOVA IMS. The focus of this summer school was to 
    find new ways to tackle urban residue and recycling using blockchains, crypto currencies and 
    smart-contracts. As part of the BitBin team, he leaded the development of a private (custom)
    blockchain based on *Ethereum*'s own blockchain whose miners would be inexpensive Raspberry Pis.
    There was also a webapp with integration with *Metamask* to simulate interactions with the 
    smart-contract running in our private network of two Raspberry Pis.

<!-- Education - MsC -->
To top off his education, Diogo enrolled in a MsC in *Informatics Engineering* at *FCUL* with a
    focus on *Software Engineering*. His subject choices where mainly in the realm of programming 
    languages, a growing interest since he begun research in the FreeST language. Some examples
    of these subjects are: Compilation Techniques (19), Domain Languages (19) and Fundamentals of 
    Programming Languages (16). To avoid a narrow specialization in programming languages, 
    varied subjects on important programming topics such as: Software Security, Middleware
    Technologies, Parallel and Concurrent Programming and Software Verification and Validation.



<!-- Experience - Monitor in practical classes in Programming I (main language Python) -->
<!-- Student volunteer @ POPL -->
<!-- Experience - INForum -->
During his MsC he also was a Monitor for practical classes in Programming I (first year, first
    semester licentiate subject), went to POPL 2021 (a programming languages conference) as a 
    Student Volunteer, and presented a [*preview* of his thesis][inforum-paper] at 
    [INForum Informatics Symposium 2022][inforum].

<!-- Education - Thesis -->
Diogo successfully presented his thesis *Shared channels on Context-free Session Types* 
    <!-- [*Shared channels on Context-free Session Types*][thesis]  -->
    with a final grade of 19. It presented an implementation of shared channels for FreeST which 
    only had linear (1-to-1) channels, thus opening a plethora of new use cases and useful 
    constructs for future FreeST programmers, such as shared data structures, standard input and 
    output, and interaction with files.



<!-- Currently working on FreeST (research) -->
<!-- Experience - Responsible for Domain Languages subject for 4 months -->
After his MsC, Diogo continued in LASIGE working on FreeST creating several tools (extensions for
    VSCode, documentation generator, and a debugger prototype), a 
    [new website for FreeST][freest-website] and, finally, working on new language improvements
    such as *Minimal Renaming* and storing source code in the language's AST for better error
    messages. 
    <!-- THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE -->
    A link between FreeST and distributed systems is in the works as an eventual source of ideas
    for further improvements.

During this time, he was also responsible for lecturing Domain Languages, a MsC subject, for half 
    a semester.
