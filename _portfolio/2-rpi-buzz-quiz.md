abstract: |
  A fun quiz game based on free and open APIs. The controllers are PlayStation 2's Buzz 
  controllers (or buzzers) for answering questions. For better language compatibility, it also
  uses Google Translate's API to translate questions and answers as best as possible to a language
  other than English.
