As of late march 2023, still at FCUL as student and investigator, I was asked if I had any activity
  ideas for FCUL's Open Day. What is Open Day? It's a day where the faculty has activities and 
  presentations for interested high-school students. It serves as a way to grow interest in what
  we do and to, in some way, *recruit* future students.

The question I put up in my head is "*What would be more interesting for high-schoolers?*". My 
  target theme was plain Programming. How do I make programming interesting for non-programmers?
  The best way, in my view, is to make something *practical* and close to them. Something sparked
  in my head: their graphical calculator!

Before I wanted to be a programmer, I was in love with physics and was ready to pursue it in 
  university. However, work opportunities were not the brightest in Portugal, and at the time a 
  friend of mine challenged me to try programming. At first it was interesting, I called it my 
  "*Lego sandbox*", but then I discovered that our calculators could be programmed by us.

TI-BASIC was my first true love in programming. I would spend hours programming tools to use in
  class and games to pass time. The ability to create something *real* with a direct effect
  was exhilarating. Because of this, I went on to learn a bit of Java and then decide to study
  Informatics Engineering in university.

Back on topic. Why not try to set these visiting students on the same path as me? So the plan
  is clear now, create a tutorial on how to program some simple games in a TI-84
  (they're overall more interesting than solving the quadratic formula). For simplicity, the
  best was to create a website for easy access across lab computers and for future reference
  if any student wanted to explore more after the activity.

# Programming with a TI-84
- Writing code
  - Calculator
  - Text editor
  - IDE
    - small text/phrases on why IDEs are important 
- TI-BASIC language
- Compiling

## TokenIDE
- VSCode is a popular IDE, however, TokenIDE was designed for our purposes and is easier 
  out-of-the-box

## TI-BASIC
- similar to BASIC
- small amount of instructions

# Building a simple website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
- Simple page with:
  - a small tutorial on how to start
  - a page for each example with:
    - short description
    - overall game logic
    - simplified code explanation
    - full code and files
    - references to 
- Jekyll + GitHub Pages
  - Theme: [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/)
  - adapted with FCUL's colors
