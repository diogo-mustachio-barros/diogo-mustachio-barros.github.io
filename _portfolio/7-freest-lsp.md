abstract: |
  Visual Studio Code extension for FreeST language support. It provides error highlighting and 
  commands to directly run in terminal or load into the interpreter. It's split into its frontend
  (in TypeScript) and its backend (in Haskell) which provides functionality using FreeST's 
  compiler's constructs.
